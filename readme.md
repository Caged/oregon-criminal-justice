An import and cleanup of Oregon county-level criminal justice data from http://navigator.state.or.us/cjc.  Unfortunately the process for acquiring this data was pretty manual so I'm rehosting it here in case anyone else might find it useful.

See http://navigator.state.or.us/cjc/CJCDataDefinitions.htm for metadata.
